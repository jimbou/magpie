1) at the beginning compare how all the metrics correlate to execution time just by rerunning them
2) compare how close the achieved fitness and the same value after rerruning 20 times was after the completion for different retries numbersv

3) check the new highs to see if some metrics are more effective and others are more efficient
4) get the new performance metrics and redo the initial calculations
5) report -- page 2, 2.5 broader applicability of optimised -- check related work
6) report -- page 4, top right - what about measurement effort?
